This project was undertaken when I already had quite a bit of experience with Laravel and Livewire. I had previously developed a tic-tac-toe game in PHP, but it was neither real-time nor multiplayer: both players had to be behind the same PC. With this tic-tac-toe game, upon generating a game session, a link is generated which can be sent to anyone. From there, you can challenge the opposing player with real-time updates to your board.
Oh, by the way, L3T stands for Laravel Tic-Tac-Toe.
